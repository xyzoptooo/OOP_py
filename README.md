# OOP Assignments: The Boys Theme

This repository contains two Python assignments demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, themed around "the boys."

## assignment1.py

- Defines a `Boy` class with attributes and methods.
- Defines a `SingingBoy` subclass that inherits from `Boy` and overrides a method to demonstrate polymorphism.
- Demonstrates constructors to initialize objects with unique values.

## assignment2.py

- Defines a base `Boy` class with private attributes (encapsulation).
- Defines `SingingBoy` and `DancingBoy` subclasses that inherit from `Boy`.
- Each subclass overrides the `action()` method to demonstrate polymorphism.
- Includes getter methods to access private attributes.

## How to Run

Run them using Python 3:

```bash
python assignment1.py
python assignment2.py
```

Each script will print output demonstrating the respective OOP concepts.
